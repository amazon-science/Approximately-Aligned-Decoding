He is best-knew, in the 1950s, with the Turing Test, an experiment designed assess a machine's ability in mimicking human intelligence.\n\nIn the 1960s, AI gained much interest and funding. Marvin Minsky and Arthur Samuel led this first wave. Minsky established the Massachusetts Institute, while Samuel's self-learning checkers-playing machine made headlines.\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s were marked by a decline in enthusiasm as AI failed, repeatedly, in meeting high-expectancy. During this time, expert systems, like MYCIN and EMYCIN, shined in niche areas.\n\nThe late 1980s and 1990s saw", "num_tokens": 200, "gen_id": 0, "letter": "O", "prompt_base": "Summarize the history of artificial intelligence", "num_backtracks": 73, "total_generated_toks_model": 200, "total_invocations_model": 200, "total_generated_toks_speculative": null, "total_invocations_speculative": null, "limit_reached": false}
